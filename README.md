### Option 1: Direct File Open
1.  Navigate to the project folder on your computer.
2.  Double-click the `index.html` file.
3.  It will open automatically in your default web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).

### Option 2: VS Code Live Server (Recommended)

2.  Right-click on `index.html`.
3.  Select **"Open with Live Server"**.

## 🎨 Features

* **Structure:** Uses semantic HTML tags (`<h1>`, `<p>`, `<img>`).
* **Media:** Demonstrates how to embed local images (`balloon.jpg`, `bird.jpg`).
* **Attributes:** Uses `alt` text for accessibility and `width`/`height` for layout control.
